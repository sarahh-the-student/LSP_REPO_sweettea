Reference: Understanding Method Overloading

User:
I am working on this question for an area calculator, but I need to know why I should use overloading, instead of separate methods. Please advise

Gemini:
That's a common point of confusion. While separate names are explicit, overloading is preferred here because it groups a family of related functions under a single, intuitive name. It treats "area" as the core concept. A developer using your class only needs to remember the verb 'area', and the compiler figures out the correct version to use based on the parameters (a radius, or a width and height). It's about creating a cleaner, more unified API for your class.

User:
So the main point is convenience and keeping the code clean.

Gemini:
Exactly. You've got the core idea. For your comment, you can phrase it like that. It improves the usability and readability of the code by establishing a clear and consistent way to perform a single action—calculating an area—across different contexts. It centralizes the concept rather than splintering it into many different method names.
